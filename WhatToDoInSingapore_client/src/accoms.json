And it dragged till 1045pm, and then I able to check into the hotel. Very poor service provided.\n\nUpon checking in, the room is very dirty. There's were dirt on the floor, hair on the floor. Hair inside the fridge. Dirty fingerprints all over the mirror. Worst of all, the door was faulty.\n\nI able to enter the hotel room without using my access card to tap in to my room. I went out during the midnight and purchase something, and leaving my girlfriend sleeping in the room alone. Without knowing the door is faulty. I only get to know my room is faulty in the next morning. So my question is, what if anything happen to my girlfriend, who is going to take responsibility for this?\n\nIsn't it housekeeper duties to ensure everything goes well in the hotel? Be it neat and tidy and ensure all the safety precautions are taken care of?",

Was told that it would take around an hour, so I left and called them again at around 5pm to confirm that my room was ready. Got there and spoke to the receptionist to collect the room card, was expecting them to take initiative to maybe offer a late check out due to having to wait, but nothing else was said. Called them in the evening to confirm check out time and they just stuck to 12pm. Overall, my stay was not terrible but definitely could've been better.",
